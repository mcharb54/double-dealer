C.</h5><div><p>Phil and Jan's relationship started with a bang. Phil, having no car, borrowed Steven's mom's station wagon for their first date. Mrs. Bowman said if he cleaned it before giving it back he could use it for the night. He and Jan sat chatting in the Cineplex parking lot after seeing <em>The Night of the Iguana</em>. Phil was anxious to make a move. Jan began fidgeting, anxious for him to make a move too. Under her seat, Jan found a little .22 pistol. Thinking it one more of Steven's brother's toys scattered about the car floor, she pointed it at Phil's head and pulled the trigger. "Bang" she said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Miraculously the bullet entered and exited without hitting his brain. One short medically induced coma later and Phil was fine with no lasting repercussions. He seemed to speak a little slower, but be that bullet wound or newly found worldview no one can be certain. While most men would have ended things then and there, Phil was under the impression that getting shot on the first date was the lowest point a relationship could hit. He asked Jan out for a second date. How could she say no?</p>
<p>Two years passed and Jan dumped Phil for Ryan Mallard. Rumor had it she had been cheating on him for at least a month, maybe more. Rumor had it that she never really liked Phil to begin with, but given the circumstances, how could she say no? It was true. She never really did love Phil, but he loved her. And it felt good to be loved. It helped ease her guilt and she embraced it. Jan told herself that over time she would come to love him just as much. But it was useless. Everything was changing. Her hair was longer and her skirts shorter. She wore a flower in her hair and worried constantly about her brother in Vietnam. She could not turn on the TV past ten at night in fear of catching footage from abroad and the possibility of seeing his face fish eyed in the mud. Everything was changing, everything except her feelings for Phil. She was attracted to Ryan Mallard, but she refused to cheat. However she knew it would happen eventually. Her guilt grew unbearable and so finally, she ended it.</p>
<p>Phil, as can happen when in love, never even considered that Jan was unhappy. They were having a beer downtown and after he paid and they walked outside, she seemed to be trembling. It was Mississippi in September and still sixty degrees out.</p>
<p>"You that cold?" Phil asked.</p>
<p>"Phil," she said, eyes closed and still shaking, “I’m breaking up with you.” And so she opened her eyes to look at him. His face looked no different. He nodded.</p>
<p>"Ok," he said. No fight. He could tell she meant it, but he did not have anything to say. It was unexpected and so he was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>"I’m sorry. I don’t know what else to say right now, so I’m just gonna go."</p>
<p>"Ok," he said again. He even tried to smile, to let her know it was ok. Because he loved her, he wanted it to be ok. He wanted to make her happy. She went one way, and he went the other.</p>
<p>By the time he got home, he knew he was not ready to let things end that way. He worried for the first time if Ryan Mallard had anything to do with her ending things. Once or twice he’d overheard people talk about the way Jan looked at him, but he thought nothing of it. Jan had told him about being cheated on by her last boyfriend. How the pain was unlike anything she had ever felt. He doubted that cheated…but that doesn’t mean she didn’t have feelings for him. Well, if Ryan thought he could take Phil’s girl without a fight, he was dearly mistaken. However, Ryan was much bigger than him and an actual fight would most certainly end poorly for Phil.</p>
<p>For the first two days of the break up Jan was replaced by whisky and the new Tom Jones album. Phil kept trying to think of ways to win her back, but quickly forgot every idea with each swig of Old Crow. On the third day, he rose again. He poured another drink and shattered the Tom Jones record as he decided Tom Jones didn’t know shit about love. Looking through his other records, he couldn’t find anything better to listen to. Phil lay motionless on his couch in silence for an hour… still no good ideas. Getting up, he decided to turn on the radio. Maybe some country song would inspire him. He sat back on the couch and lit a cigarette.</p>
<p>"Oh, it’s that time of year again boys and girls! Come one, come all to the world’s greatest show! The Ringling Brothers are back for this weekend only. As always, they’ve got clowns! They’ve got lions! But, for the first time ever you can come and meet Mona the elephant!" The announcer went on like this for a while, but Phil had tuned out. Jan loves <em>Dumbo</em>, he thought. She did love <em>Dumbo</em> as a child, but she had outgrown that love. If only he could get his hands on Mona. Jan would be so thrilled to see a real elephant that she’d have to take him back. Maybe it was the whiskey, but he just knew it to be true.</p>
<p>Phil called his brother Pete. If there was anyone in town who would help, it was certainly Pete. He was two years younger and had a reputation for being the craziest, most daring kid around. Pete was already a local legend, only nineteen years old. He slapped a nun in the face, some said. Others claimed he once rode a motorcycle into the high school and left skid marks in the front hallway. Years later, their own father would say "You’re the only person who has ever been invited to every high school reunion in town." It was true, Pete was kicked out of every school in the area until finally there were none left and he didn’t graduate at all.</p>
<p>"Hey momma," Phil said trying not to sound drunk. “Is Pete there with y’all? I gotta ask him something.” Phil’s momma hollered for Pete. A minute later he picked up the phone.</p>
<p>"Why’re you calling me before noon?" Pete said.</p>
<p>"I got an idea and I need your help. Wake your ass up and come over here." Phil tapped his foot waiting for Pete to respond.</p>
<p>Pete yawned and said, "What’re you gettin’ on about now?"</p>
<p>"Just come over and we can work it out. We’re gonna borrow an elephant from the circus."</p>
<p>Pete didn’t say anything for a minute. "Alright, I’ll be over in a bit." He hung up the phone. Phil grinned to himself and decided to hop in the shower. He knew Pete would take his time getting there.</p>
<p>"So here’s how I see it," said Pete. He was sitting across from Phil, pulverizing a nugget of weed with his fingers and letting it fall on the table. “The show will be over by nine. Them carnies will have them animals locked back up right after. I’ve snuck around there before with Dave and Mike to mess with the tigers. Last time they were in town they had one guy watching all the cages and he was fast asleep in his chair by time we showed up. I say we leave here by ten thirty and we won’t have a problem sneaking that elephant out.”</p>
<p>"What if he’s awake?"</p>
<p>"Then I’ll hit him once and he’ll be knocked out ‘till we leave."</p>
<p>"I ain’t trying to get arrested now Pete."</p>
<p>"And you won’t! I told you I’d hit him." Pete said. He sprinkled the powdery green into the paper, rolled it with a flourish and sealed it with a kiss.</p>
<p>"Mind if I join you?" Phil asked.</p>
<p>"Sure you can… for a dollar."</p>
<p>"Go fuck yourself, I ain’t paying for your lousy pot."</p>
<p>Phil and Pete sat the rest of the afternoon smoking and talking over their plan. The day became dark and they headed to Dairy Queen for burgers and then back home to drink and smoke a bit more. Ten thirty crept up on them and they noticed ten minutes late.</p>
<p>"Shit," said Phil. “We should get going.” They downed the last of the beer and threw on their boots. Once they got close to the fairgrounds Phil shut off the truck’s lights and parked a ways down the road to walk the over in the dark. Pete grabbed the wire cutters from the bed of the truck.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, “If we’re doing it, we’re doing it I guess.” Phil nodded. They walked slowly and hunched over through the field. They went right at the tent entrance and made their way around back to the animal cages. Pete peeked his head around the corner to see if anyone was there.</p>
<p>"Our guy’s still awake," said Pete. “You want to head back and try again in a bit or what?”</p>
<p>"We’re this close, though." Phil said. He leaned against the tent and tried to think of what to do. “How about this? You go over there and talk to him. I’ll sneak around the other side, clip the lock, take the elephant the way I came and then you come around and meet me.”</p>
<p>"What the fuck am I supposed to talk to him about?" Pete asked.</p>
<p>Phil responded, "Ask him about anything. The weather, the carnival, how does tiger shit smell? Just make sure he’s focused on you long enough for me to get in and out."
Pete considered the plan. “Alright… But if he see’s you I’m going to act like it’s a coincidence and get the hell out of here.”</p>
<p>"Deal."</p>
<p>Phil walked out into the dark to sneak around the other side. When Pete could no longer see him, he took a deep breath and made his way over to the guard.</p>
<p>"How’s it going mister?" The man looked tired and filthy. When he got close, Pete realized he was a midget. Smudges of clown makeup were on his neck and forehead.</p>
<p>"You’re not supposed to be back here. Circus’ been closed for hours nah." He was missing all his front teeth save one canine on top and two front ones on bottom.</p>
<p>"Aw, sorry about that." Pete said with a pause making it clear he wasn’t about to turn and go. “Say… what’s tiger shit smell like?”</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"I’m just curious. Y’all got tigers right? They gotta shit don’t they?"</p>
<p>" ‘Course they shit."</p>
<p>"Well that’s what I thought. So what’s it smell like?" Pete glanced behind the man and saw Phil looking for the elephant cage. Phil came to one of the larger ones and couldn’t see what was inside. He stuck his head up to the bars and looked in. Looking back was a tiger, eyes catching the dim light. Phil quickly removed his head.</p>
<p>"Smells like your cat’s shit, only worse!" The carnie said.</p>
<p>"No kidding," said Pete. “Y’all keep a litter box in the cage for it then?”</p>
<p>"No we don’t got no litter box."</p>
<p>"My mom just got some of that tidy cats litter for her cats. You seen that? She used to never let the cats inside because they’d piss on her rugs. Saw an ad for a thing called a litter box and now she won’t let the damn things back outside."</p>
<p>"That’s nice and all kid, but what the hell do you want? I ain’t supposed to let people back here."</p>
<p>Phil had come up on Mona’s cage. The great beast was lying down sleeping. Phil had figured it would sleep upright like a horse in a stable. He had never been this close to an elephant before. The only other time he had seen one in person was years ago at the Zoo in New Orleans. He reached in to his pocket for one of the peanuts he brought. Huh, he thought, what sound do you make to call an elephant? He clicked his tongue to the roof of his mouth the way some people do to call cats. He thought about whistling but realized it would probably draw the carnie’s attention. He decided to toss one of the peanuts at her. Mona’s eyes opened and he extended another nut.</p>
<p>"There you go, come get the peanut." He whispered. Mona slowly rose. “Shh.” The grey creature wore an oversized dog collar around its neck and there was a length of rope wrapped up and hanging on the side of the cage. Phil stuck out his hand with the peanut and Mona sucked it to her trunk and plopped it in her mouth. Then she began sniffing his pockets.</p>
<p>"Woah now." He whispered. “We only just met. But you be quiet and there’s more where that came from.” The elephant shook its head from side to side, waking itself back up. Phil picked up the bolt cutter and put it to the chain locking the cage. Doing his best to make no sound, he deftly clipped the link and let the length of chain fall on his knee to keep it from rattling. He pulled the chain out and placed it on the ground. Then he opened the gate and took a step closer to Mona. He pulled out another peanut for her. She took it and he got even closer. He stroked her leathery ear and patted her on the neck. She didn’t seem to mind him. Walking over to the side he grabbed the rope and tied it to her collar. Now was the tricky part. Getting her out.</p>
<p>"I don’t know man. Between you and me, I’m pretty drunk. I live near here and thought I’d come check it out." Pete told the carnie. “Not every day the circus is in town, you know? Well… I guess it is for you.”</p>
<p>"Yeah it is," the carnie grinned his two teeth at Pete, “…you wouldn’t happen to have any liquor on ya, would ya?” Pete grinned back and reached into his boot and pulled out a flask.</p>
<p>" ’Course I do. Here." He handed it over to the Carnie. The little man cocked his head back and took a big swig. He wiped the lip of it on his sleeve and passed it back.</p>
<p>"Thank ya." He burped. “Now look, I know I ain’t supposed to have people back here, but since ya been so kind and all, ya want me to show ya the critters?”</p>
<p>Phil had walked out the length of rope and stood with a peanut extended. Mona took a step towards him and he took a step back. After a couple of steps Mona picked up the pace and Phil nearly tripped over backwards trying to keep the peanut out of reach. Pete saw Phil get out the other side and grinned.</p>
<p>"That sounds great man, but I should get goin’. It’s late and I’d hate for you to get in trouble. But here," he said, tossing him the flask. “I’ll come get that tomorrow and you can show me then.”</p>
<p>"Awful kind of you." He took another sip. “See you tomorrow then.” Pete nodded and walked away casually. Once he was far enough away he sprinted over to Phil and Mona. He threw his arm around Phil’s shoulders and said, “Why can’t you be like this all the time?”</p>
<p>"Quiet down." Phil said with a grin. He was ready to shout himself. A goddamned elephant, he thought. He just stole a goddamned elephant. Now all he had to do was get the thing to Jan’s house and get her to come outside. She’d see the thing, fall in love with it and return fall back in love with him.</p>
<p>"If we cut through the woods we can be at Jan’s in about twenty minutes." Phil said.</p>
<p>"The woods? No, just throw the elephant in the bed of your truck and we’ll drive over."</p>
<p>"There’s no way she’ll fit back there. And even if she could, who’s to say she won’t jump out? Not to mention someone would be bound to notice a truck hauling an elephant."</p>
<p>Pete thought about it and said, "I guess you’re right… But I’m riding the thing on the way over."</p>
<p>"Alright. But once we get to Jan’s I’ll be the one sitting on her," Phil said. He handed Pete a peanut. “Here, feed her this so she trusts you and I’ll help you up.”</p>
<p>Pete looked incredulous, the realization hitting him that he’d never been near an elephant and now he was going to try and ride one. "When’d you become such an expert?" He asked.</p>
<p>"I don’t know," Shrugged Phil, “But it worked for me.”</p>
<p>They got to the edge of the woods and stopped. Pete extended the peanut to Mona and she gladly accepted. Pete grinned stupidly at Phil. Confident now, Pete hugged Mona around the neck and kissed the grey blob that was her cheek. Phil, still holding her rope, stood next to her and stroked her side. He put his hands together and Pete placed his foot in. He was up in no time.</p>
<p>"Just a fat grey horse." Pete said.</p>
<p>Phil led Mona and Pete through the woods, occasionally handing Mona peanuts. He spent every summer as a child roaming around the woods in town with friends. Even in the dark he knew how to get around in them.</p>
<p>"Hey Phil, you got that flask on you?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. What, did you drink all of yours already?"</p>
<p>"Nah, I gave it to that midget."</p>
<p>"So I’m supposed to give you mine?"</p>
<p>"C’mon now. I feel like a king up here. I think a king deserves a drink."</p>
<p>Phil reached in his back pocket and pulled out his flask. "Remember to leave me some." He tossed it up to Pete.</p>
<p>"Thank ya kindly."</p>
<p>Lights could now be seen up ahead. They were behind some houses across the street from Jan’s. Mona trumpeted her horn and Pete nearly fell off in surprise. Phil stopped to make sure she wasn’t going to keep on. She didn’t make another sound and Phil started walking again. They made it across the street and into Jan’s yard. Neither brother had said a word since they got out of the woods.</p>
<p>"So." Phil said.</p>
<p>"So, now what?" Pete replied. He leaned forward placing his elbows on Mona’s head and balancing his own atop his fists.</p>
<p>"I’ll have you get down and help me up. Then you ring her bell and hide."</p>
<p>"You want me to hide?"</p>
<p>"Yeah I want you to hide. I’m the one winning her back."</p>
<p>Pete slid off Mona and helped Phil up. "Ok," he said. Mona stood there patiently, occasionally bending her trunk back towards Phil’s pocket. Pete set down Mona’s rope and put his hand out. “Stay,” he said.</p>
<p>"She’s not a dog, Pete."</p>
<p>He walked over to Jan’s door and rang the bell a bunch of times. After a minute a light came on. Jan’s head poked out the front door a moment later. She looked tired and confused that no one was standing there.</p>
<p>"Hey there sweetheart!" Phil called.</p>
<p>"Phil?" She said, opening the door fully now. She was standing in her nightgown, brown hair untied and falling down her back. She stepped outside and realized what it was she was looking at. “What the fuck, Phil?”</p>
<p>"Surprise! This here is my new friend Mona. I was telling her about you and she insisted we come say hello."</p>
<p>Jan rushed over and looked around at the other houses to see if anyone was watching. "What the hell are you thinking, stealing this poor thing?"</p>
<p>"I was thinking that I love you, and I know you love elephants, so I thought I’d bring you one."
“You don’t expect me to keep a stolen elephant.” Jan said.</p>
<p>" ‘Course you can’t keep her. And quit saying ‘stole’. I’m giving her back. Aren’t you happy? I <em>borrowed</em> an elephant—just for you."</p>
<p>"Phil, turn around now and get her back to the circus."</p>
<p>"I intend to. But we need to talk first Jan."</p>
<p>"I’m not talking to you sitting up there." She said. Phil swept his foot over and slid down. When he hit the ground, he stumbled a bit drunkenly. “Of course you’re drunk too.” Phil fed Mona another peanut.</p>
<p>"I’m not that drunk, it’s just hard to get off an elephant… Now, can we talk?"</p>
<p>"I have nothing to say to you. I’m sorry if this has been hard for you, but I don’t want to be with you Phil."</p>
<p>"But I brought you a goddamned elephant!" He stamped his foot. “I bet Ryan Mallard would never do something like this.”</p>
<p>Jan was calm. She hated seeing Phil like this, and truth be told she was impressed. But that couldn’t change the fact she just didn’t love him. "No Phil, I’m sure he wouldn’t. Can you go now so that I can get some sleep?"</p>
<p>"Not until we talk." He said, unsteady but unwavering. Jan was losing her composure.</p>
<p>"If you wanted to talk, you should have come over here and talked. But you never wanted that, admit it. You thought you could do something like this and that I’d be so taken by the gesture that we’d skip the part where we talk and just get back together."</p>
<p>"That ain’t true."</p>
<p>"You know it is though. I bet you sat around all day drinking and thinking this up. Bet you thought it was fool proof. But I ain’t a fool, Phil. Two years together and I know you better than you ever got to know me. You’re all ready to talk now when you should have been more ready to listen then."</p>
<p>Phil didn’t know what to say. Jan was right—about it all—and he was beginning to let himself realize it. He loved her, but he didn’t know her. It was a young love, propelled by pure attraction. Maybe not even love, but idolatry. To him she was a figure, pristine and hollow. Of course he knew things about her—they were together two years. But it was not as though he was invested in those things. What she liked and didn’t like, or how she felt about the world. He never once began to consider all those qualities that made her Jan. In reality, he had just decided one day that he loved her. Never thinking to ask why.</p>
<p>Mona, being an elephant and therefore not invested in Phil’s troubles, took a shit.</p>
<p>Jan said, "Oh Lord. Alright Phil, time to go." He still said nothing, but nodded, picked up Mona’s rope and began to leave.</p>
<p>"Wait!" she cried. After a moment she said, “I know you must hate me right now… but can I feed her just one of those peanuts?”</p>
<p>Sighing, Phil reached in his pocket and handed it to her. Jan, calm again, fed it to Mona and petted her ear. "Thank you. Get home safe and try not to get arrested."</p>
<p>Without looking up, Phil said "Ok."</p>
<p>Jan turned around and went inside. He lingered until he saw her light shut off. Pete came out from where he was hiding in the bushes. He put his arm around his brother. "At least she’ll have to clean up that pile of shit tomorrow."</p>
<p>"I guess," said Phil. The two brothers walked back towards the woods with their sleepy elephant. “So do we sneak her back in, or give her to the guard?”</p>
<p>"I have a different idea," said Pete. “I say we head down Main Street, grab a drink at Fat Jack’s and show off our new friend.”</p>
<p>"I don’t think so. The cops will get wind of it right away."</p>
<p>"Look Phil, just watching you go through that made me want a drink so I can only imagine how you feel. And," Pete said, reaching in his boot and tossing the flask to Phil. “I finished your whiskey.”</p>
<p>"Damn it, Pete."</p>
<p>"C’mon. If anything goes wrong, I’ll let you run off and tell the police it was all me. It’s not like they’ll have any doubts."</p>
<p>Maybe it was the disappointment or maybe it was just how much he had to drink already, but Phil considered the idea. If Jan wasn’t going to appreciate the trouble he went to, the guys down at Fat Jacks sure would.</p>
<p>"Let’s do it."</p>
<p>It was just past midnight as Phil and Pete walked downtown to Main Street. They didn’t see a single car. The only people in town left awake at this hour were already at Fat Jacks, and no one in that crowd would be leaving before last call. Neither Pete or Phil hopped back up on Mona, instead they took turns holding the rope and guiding her down the road. They turned onto Main Street and continued down towards the bar. Phil looked at their lamp lit reflection in the Sears-Roebuck window. He couldn’t help but smile at the sight of two country boys walking with the gentle grey beast.</p>
<p>Pete walked into the bar ahead of Phil. "Hey there everybody, I got a special girl coming in with me tonight, so I’m gonna need y’all to behave yourselves. Mona, you can come in now!" Phil backed in through the swinging saloon doors pulling Mona in. The handful drunk men and women at the bar cried out in shock, burst into laughter or both.</p>
<p>Jack was tending his bar, "Well, this is a first. How’d you convince the circus folk to let you take that thing, Pete?"</p>
<p>"How ‘bout we don’t ask those questions Jack, and we just enjoy it instead?"</p>
<p>"Well, shit." Jack said, but asked no further questions. Instead he poured drinks for Pete and Phil. “Consider this round pay for the entertainment.”</p>
<p>They spent the next hour regaling the crowd with the events leading up to their arrival at the bar. It hadn’t been twenty-four hours and already Pete began embellishing what happened into something more attune with the other stories people would tell about him for years to come. The only difference is that he didn’t hesitate in letting people know it was all Phil’s idea.</p>
<p>"Why’d you take her?" some cute blonde in her twenties asked Phil, when he first sat down at the bar. He’d never seen her before, but he noticed her with Bill Davy when he walked in. He didn’t know Bill was back from the war. Hopefully she was his cousin from out of town.</p>
<p>"To win a girl back, but here I am."</p>
<p>"She said no? Well she must be certifiably insane," she said and touched his shoulder. “If a boy ever did anything half as romantic as that for me, I’d just about marry him on the spot.” It didn’t take long for all of the attention, and booze, to get Phil’s mood back up. Bill Davy came back and stood near them.</p>
<p>"I guess it’s a shame it wasn’t you then," he said trying to sound sly.</p>
<p>"Bill! Do y’all know each other?" she asked. Josie was her name. Turns out, she was Bill’s steady. Bill had gotten back stateside a week ago, after having a bullet tear through his side at something called “Operation Hastings.” She was working as a nurse at the evac hospital he was sent to for recovery. Josie told Phil that unlike all the other soldiers there, Bill wasn’t interested in talking about himself, his life back home. Instead, all he did was ask her about Georgia, where she was from. About her family, what she was like in high school, how she was feeling being around all the sick and wounded.</p>
<p>"He treated me like I was the one injured," she said and clasped Bill’s hand tightly. When he had recovered enough to be sent home, Josie followed him. The first thing they did was stop at the courthouse to get married. They hadn’t even looked at rings yet.</p>
<p>"Phil! We got a bucket full of beer for Mona!" called Pete. He set it down in front of her and guided her trunk to it. She inhaled it and sprayed it out on the bar. Everyone cheered at this. Mona didn’t spray the rest; instead she drank the whole bucket. “Jack, I think she wants another!”</p>
<p>The night crept on and everyone continued drinking past last call. They gave Mona at least two more buckets full of beer. After that, the elephant laid herself down on the wood floor and closed her eyes. Phil continued talking with Josie and Bill the rest of the night. Tired and defeated, he liked hearing about how happy they made each other. Pete talked to everyone else. The grey light of morning began filling the bar from the front window, getting brighter by the minute as the sun slowly pushed itself up over that infinitesimal line of earth.</p>
<p>"That’s him!" said a voice from the doorway. It was the carnie with two cops standing behind him.</p>
<p>"Pete?" said one cop, “Well I should have known.”</p>
<p>"Of course," said the other.</p>
<p>Grinning the whole time, Pete stood up with his hands raised high above his head and walked over to the cops. "Do you even need to cuff me? I know the drill and I’m not resisting."</p>
<p>"Go sit in the car," said the first cop. Pete did as he was told. He didn’t get in the car, but stood next to it and smoked a cigarette.</p>
<p>"Alright, I’ll wake her up and one of you can help me walk her back." The carnie told the cops. They went over to where Mona was sleeping and he snapped his fingers to get her attention.</p>
<p>"Get up you beast!" he cried. Mona just stretched her massive legs and continued sleeping. The carnie handed the rope to one of the cops and said, “Here, tug on this and she’ll get up.” The officer tugged, lightly at first and then with all his weight, but still Mona didn’t budge. The people at the bar were all laughing hysterically.</p>
<p>"She’s already one of us!" someone cried. Even the officers seemed amused. After a few more attempts to no avail, they gave up.</p>
<p>"Look, how bout we just let the damned thing sleep this off and we’ll come by later today with a horse trailer and drive her over to y’all?" the cop asked. Jack said he was fine with that, and that he’d make sure it wouldn’t wake up and wreck his bar.</p>
<p>"I guess that’ll have to do," said the carnie. And so he and the police left together with Pete in the back of the car. Phil said goodnight to everyone and headed to the police station to get him out of jail. The carnie, perhaps thankful for Pete giving him his whiskey, decided not to press charges. After that, the police had nothing left to keep Pete detained—there was no law against bringing an elephant into a bar.</p>
<p>The following day the front page of the paper ran a small article on the upper right hand side about a new law. The headline read: "NO DRUNK ELEPHANTS ALLOWED ON MAIN STREET."</p></div></div></div></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/blog/elephants";window.webpackCompilationHash="bad81b4f85c8e9c2f6b3";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-3c1e7d92fdbde3e537f7.js"],"component---node-modules-gatsby-plugin-offline-app-shell-js":["/component---node-modules-gatsby-plugin-offline-app-shell-js-01d89fb0e60ae899ae1d.js"],"component---src-templates-blog-template-js":["/component---src-templates-blog-template-js-1bc8f615cc737aacac34.js"],"component---src-pages-about-js":["/component---src-pages-about-js-e58ff6ef03b015417ef6.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-3c376b1fea444d86efed.js"],"component---src-pages-my-files-js":["/component---src-pages-my-files-js-fbda65ad468e1aefe6b3.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/webpack-runtime-1d03c35415e7f52841a4.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-3c1e7d92fdbde3e537f7.js" async=""></script><script src="/component---src-templates-blog-template-js-1bc8f615cc737aacac34.js" async=""></script><script src="/0-6c56b6aa284c1a68955f.js" async=""></script></body></html>
