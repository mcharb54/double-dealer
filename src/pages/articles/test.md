Phil and Jan's relationship started with a bang. Phil, having no car, borrowed Steven's mom's station wagon for their first date. Mrs. Bowman said if he cleaned it before giving it back he could use it for the night. He and Jan sat chatting in the Cineplex parking lot after seeing _The Night of the Iguana_. Phil was anxious to make a move. Jan began fidgeting, anxious for him to make a move too. Under her seat, Jan found a little .22 pistol. Thinking it one more of Steven's brother's toys scattered about the car floor, she pointed it at Phil's head and pulled the trigger. "Bang" she said with a laugh.
