**Editors Note**—

A unique chapter in the romantic history of New Orleans was contributed by Lafcadio Hearn some thirty-five years ago to the _Southern Bivouac_ of Louisville, soon after defunct, which we here reprint.

This item, for some reason, has escaped the eyes of the several editors who have in- dustrially dug out from various periodicals and journals, vagrant matter of this now highly appreciated litterateur. No collected volume, so far as we know, of the many posthumous publications contains this very interesting example of Lafcadio Hearn done in his best style. The character of Llulla, fifty years ago, was a well-known celebrity of the Vieux Carre and in his old age ran a cemetery on Louisa Street, where he held court in the matters of the code duello dispensing service before or after as required.

**SENOR** Don Jose Llulla, or Pepii Llulla, as he is more affection- ately styled by his admirers, is a person whose name has become legend- ary even in his life-time. While compara- tively few are intimate with him, for he is a reserved man, there is scarcely a citizen who does not know him by name, and hardly a New Orleans urchin who could not tell you that "Pepe Llulla is a great duelist who has a cemetery of his own." Although strictly true, this information is apt to create a false im- pression of some connection between Pepe's duels, and Pepe's necropolis; the fact being that none of his enemies re- pose in the Louisa-street cemetery, which he owns, and that he has never killed enough men to fill a solitary vault. There is, in short, no relationship be- tween the present and the past occupa- tions of the cemetery proprietor; but before speaking of the former, I may attempt to give a brief outline of the career of this really extraordinary character who won his way to fortune and to fame by rare energy and intre- pidity. Pepe was born near Port Mahon, capital of Minorca, one of those Balea- ric Islands whose inhabitants were celebrated in antiquity for their skill in the use of missile-weapons, and have passed under so many dominations— Carthaginian, Roman, Vandal, Moorish, Spanish, French, and English. His own uncommon dexterity in the use of arms, however, does not appear due to any physical inheritance from ancient Ba- learic forefathers, as he traces back his family to a Moorish origin. This asser- tion, in view of Pepe's chestnut hair and bluish-gray eyes, would seem untenable unless we reflect that those desert horsemen who first invaded Spain in the cause of Islam were mostly Berbers, kindred of the strange nomads who still preserve their fair skins and blue eyes under the sun of the Sahara—the "Veiled People," who are known afar off by their walk, "long and measured, like the stride of the ostrich." I can not say that Pepe is really a Berber; but he possesses physical characteris- tics which harmonize well with the de- scriptions in Henri Duveyrier's "Les Toureg du Nord"; and Southern Louisi- ana is full of surprises for the ethnog- rapher. The photograph, which obtained so much celebrity, was taken more than fifteen years ago, and Pepe has but slightly changed since then. He is only a little grayer, and remains very erect, agile, and elastic in his movements; a man about the average height, rather vigorously than powerfully built. He attributes his excellent physical preser-
