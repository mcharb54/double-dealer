A foam of lightning breaks on the barred pane.
He shudders: *voltage......stretches you apart*
*As it does bleeding roots, and trunks that start*
*And twist alive and writhe up off the plain*
*Like threads of tortured silver*..... But the guards—
Monstrous deft dolls that move as on a string—
In wonted haste to finish with this thing,
Turn faces blanker than asphalted yards.

They hear the shriek that tore out of its sheath
But as a feeble moan... yet dare not breathe,
Who stare there at him, arching—like a tree
When the winds wrench it and the earth holds tight—
To fuse in flaming circuit with the night
His soul, expanding with white agony.

**LOLA RIDGE.**
