As men for pastime may direct their wit
  As they see fit
And thus turn tailor or green-groceryman
  For their life's span—
As men turn tailor for their life's pastime,
  I turn my hand to rhyme.

Poets be damn'd! if by that word be meant
Lean, shaggy devils who will pay no rent,
  Belaboring the world because it still
  Cares no two hoots in hell
    For any dream
    That they may deem
    Fit subject for a canticle—
Lean, shiftless devils who have never yet
Earned silver with a decent sweat,
Yet deafen heaven with astounding cries,
Storming for pennies which the world denies.

Not mine to spin long garments of regret
  In rhymes that fret,
And, when the night's too long,
Whimper a whining song
  Not mine to draw aside
With sullen songs of pride
  Because I dream the world has done me wrong.

As men turn tailor for their life's pastime,
  I turn my hand to rhyme.
  And whether the world cares
  Or not, for my small wares
Makes very trifling difference to me.
  With delicate, deft stitches
  I fashion little breeches
For casual customers of my fantasy.

**JOHN MCCLURE.**
