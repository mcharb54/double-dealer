I was a warrior in the Roman age
And with some Caesar swung a doughty sword.
By lion-hearted Richard did I wage
Grim combat with the Saracenic horde.

I was a knight-at-arms in Lancelot's day
And tilted Fame in many a tournament.
With Pete Ronsard I wrought the roundelay,
With brother Franc Villon his testament.

I was a courtier in Jack Suckling's time,
A gallant in the days of Dick Lovelace,
And more than one fine sonnet did I rhyme
To win some token of my lady's grace.

In Spenser's generation I aspired
A patron in the person of the King.
With Master William Shakespeare I acquired
A canniness for almost anything.

With Amerigo and Christopher I sailed
Uncharted seas to continents unknown.
By Jack Lafitte and "Johnny" Jones I hailed
The empery of the waters as my own.

With Danny Boone and Davy Crockett, I
Did blaze a trail where never man abode.
Last year I battled Boches in the sky —
Today I am a salesman "on the road."
