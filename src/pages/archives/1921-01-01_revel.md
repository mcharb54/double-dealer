Bring with ye gizzards of the Laughing Goose
And bring the juice
Of monkeys, penguins and vain cockatoos.
Saint Aristippus and Saint Laughing Tom,
Prithee now come,
We shall incant a spell
As solemn as all hell.

Saint Rabelais, ay, and saintly Anatole,
I pray ye all,
Saints Dekker, Butler, and Democritus
All-glorious,
Come with the feathers of the popinjay
And goose-down grey
And gentle dilberries gathered by the way.
Come now and grace this revel
As solemn as the devil.

For we shall chant hereby in incantation
In honor of creation:
With reverent step and upward-rolling eye
We shall give praise most high
To God and Man and their great Destination.
High-stepping round the cauldron we shall call
Sure, one and all,
Those Sprites Primordial
Out from the womb of darkness and no-time
To join us in a rhyme
To join us in a toast in this holy revel
As solemn as the devil,
Will drink their bumpers in a chanted spell

For we shall give them wine
Finer than superfine,
Brewed in our cauldrons to God and Man and the Great Holy Ghost.
Made rich with gizzards of the Laughing Goose
And monkey-juice.
As solemn as all hell,
