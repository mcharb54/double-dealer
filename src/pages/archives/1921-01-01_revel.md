Saint Aristippus and Saint Laughing Tom,
Prithee now come,
Bring with ye gizzards of the Laughing Goose
And bring the juice
Of monkeys, penguins and vain cockatoos.
We shall incant a spell
As solemn as all hell.

Saint Rabelais, ay, and saintly Anatole,
I pray ye all,
Saints Dekker, Butler, and Democritus
All-glorious,
Come with the feathers of the popinjay
And goose-down grey
And gentle dilberries gathered by the way.
Come now and grace this revel
As solemn as the devil.

For we shall chant hereby an incantation
In honor of creation:
With reverent step and upward-rolling eye
We shall give praise most high
To God and Man and their great Destination.
High-stepping round the cauldron we shall call
The Sprites Primordial
Out from the womb of darkness and no-time
To join us in a rhyme
In honor of them all:
To join us in a toast
To God and Man and the Great Holy Ghost.

Sure, one and all,
Those Sprites Primordial
Will drink their bumpers in this holy revel
As solemn as the devil,
For we shall give them wine
Finer than superfine,
Brewed in our cauldrons to a chanted spell
As solemn as all hell,
Made rich with gizzards of the Laughing Goose
And monkey-juice.
