There was four swinging suns in heaven,
There was four rolling seas on earth,
The stars was seventy and seven
Before Gay Thomas came to birth.

Gay Thomas he was born of woman,
Gay Thomas was a son of man,
There was four swinging suns in heaven
When Gay Thomas' life began.

Gay Thomas lived in pomp and glory,
Gay Thomas was an earthly prince,
Gay Thomas span a famous story
Of wonder and magnificence.

There is four swinging suns in heaven,
There is four rolling seas on earth,
The stars is seventy and seven
And theirs is all the mirth.
