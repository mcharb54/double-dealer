<h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight:bold; color: inherit;">Editors' Note</h2>

_In honor of Joe Biden's inauguration as the 46th President of the United States, we are republishing an editorial from the second issue of "The Double Dealer." The editorial below was published almost exactly 100 years ago in response to the swearing in of then-President Warren G. Harding, who campaigned on the malapropism of a "return to normalcy.”_ 

_On the event of this year’s inauguration, NBC News described the occasion as “radically normal.” Swap a name, here or there, and it becomes clear both how much and how little can change in a century's time._
