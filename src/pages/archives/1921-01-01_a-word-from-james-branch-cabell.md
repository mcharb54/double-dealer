*Letter dated November 1920*

Editors of The Double Dealer.

Gentlemen:

Your program, as announced, is ambitious and mellifluous and generally attractive, with perhaps the minor fault of being a trifle beyond the scope of human ability. But that, as touches literary endeavor anyhow, is errancy on the right side.

I do not know how any personal benevolence toward an as yet unpublished magazine can well be voiced save with a formal wish for all imaginable success well merited; this much, however, one may desire for you most heartily. From actual criticism the unborn share with the dead — to be sure, more cheery and less immutable reasons — exemption; and in either case, the bystander's role can only be that of tacit hopefulness. The Double Dealer, after a prologue committed to sinking or swimming by virtue of its own inherent virtues — such was the luck you may deserve — can, I imagine, any more true and tonic avowal as herald for the second Double Dealer's outset.

Therefore I wish you the luck you may deserve, in friendly confidence that your merits may thus add up to some quite unexampled prosperity.

Yours faithfully,

**JAMES BRANCH CABELL.**

Dumbarton Grange,
Dumbarton, Virginia.
