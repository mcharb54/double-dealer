"The chief wants to see you."

It was the office boy of my Sunday editor who spoke. I beat him back to the desk by three feet. The chief glared at me, hid his income tax blank in a drawer, and said mildly:

"Benson, go get an interview with Bacchus on prohibition."

My ears stiffened like a man's in the Sahara who has just been told there was a brewery on the other side of the next sandheap. I had a standing start, but Mahomet — you know.

"You mean, boss, Bacchus, the original rum-hound?" I falsettoed, my voice seeming to come out of my eyes.

"Why, you don't think I mean the president of the Fudge Union, do you?" he said, hiding his patent space cutter in a drawer.

He swivelled around to his Them-the-Gate list. I knew the interview was over. I knew I had to get that interview with Bacchus somewhere, somehow, some way. I ambled out on Broadway, to sign up somewhere else.

"What! you never heard of psychometry?"

I turned quickly. Two men, arguing excitedly, disappeared. But the word "psychometry" remained. Was it a hunch? What in the Sacred Soup of Siam was psychometry? I turned into the nearest branch public library and feverishly turned the leaves of the dictionary. Psychometry is a trick among the Occult Squad. It is "divination by the history of an object by holding it in your hand. Hold your sweetheart's fan and her flirtations will swim into your brain. Press a dollar in your hand and the name of your landlord's profiteering crimes will be yours — if you have psychometric powers, a man of touch."

A great thought-flash illuminated me. Maybe I had that power — maybe I was a born psychometrist. A tremendous thought opened in me. If I had that power, why couldn't I, by holding a bottle of old Burgundy in my fist and letting my cerebrum and cerebellum float on their backs in my consciousness, evoke Bacchus and interview him?

Another hitch — but the bottle of Burgundy? It was as rare at that time as a ten-cent pack of cigarettes, worth its weight in radium, and the Eighteenth Amendment sleuths were full upon me.

One thought pumps another out of our memory. I knew the butler of "Old Pale Ale" Smith, the millionaire clubman up the Avenue. He and his family were at Palm Beach. Would the butler let me into "Pale Ale's" wine cellar, estimated to contain about a billion dollars' worth of joy-juice in the mansion? Easiest thing ever. Tom Pourboire not only let me in the cellar, but spread a table for me down there, and yanked out a bottle of old Burgundy. I was his bona-fide guest, under the law; he should worry and so forth.

I buried my fist in the dust of the bottle of the unopened wine — I wasn't after the drink this time — and called:

"Oh, Bacchus, God of Booze, be with me now! You've done me many a rotten turn before the Ginmillennium set in — now you can do me a good turn. Appear, dear old Bac.!"

There was a terrible commotion away back in the dark of that vast cellar. Boxes and casks rumbled and fell. Into the light walked Bacchus. He was flesh and blood!

I knew he was Bacchus although he had a Jack Dempsey haircut, wore a bartender's white apron, a sport shirt, and a Japanese silk crêpe tie. His face was the image of the late Johnny Walker. He carried a large bottle of wine in his hand, with the Latin inscription in huge letters burned in the glass: "From the cellars of Nero, Chateau Orgy, Anno 61."

After shaking hands with me and addressing me as "Benson old pal," he took a seat on a cask of whiskey.

"Talk low and quick," he said. "I've got old John Barleycorn, Grandfather Gambrinus and Little Lord Absinthe back in that corner. We're hiding from the raiders. Ain't this a great disguise? I dress according to the country. We're trying to drink up everything Old Pale Ale has in his cellar before he gets back from the beach."

"The gang back there are sick — it's a darkness of drinking all the stored stuff. You know I could always carry it — 'Where there's a wine there's a way' — with me. Well, go ahead, Benson, and spill your wheeze."

"What are you doing on earth, anyway, old boy?" I asked, looking at my questionnaire in my hat.

"Well, you humans put it over on us when the Great War got going. Mars took over all the gods and put Olympus on a war basis. He said this was the biggest job he'd ever pulled, wanted clear heads about him, and that the gods had to cut out drink. Of course he was only looking straight at me.

"John Barleycorn said he could handle himself, because John could never handle himself. He didn't care much about Gambrinus — said he was only a German milkman after all. He didn't even argue with Little Lord Absinthe — just instinctively booted him into the Styx, where Charon kept kicking him along in disgust. But for me he had some respect; said I was as ancient as the earth, the gods and everything else. Tapping me on the bean wouldn't do any good, so he granted me a vacation to the Earth till he got through with his war measures.

"I took the three of them back there with me, and I've certainly had my troubles ever since. Truth to tell, Benson, we've been stuck up since we landed. I'm so damned stuck that I don't know how I'll get that gang back. Pegasus has become an old spavin. We're stuck."

"How did prohibition in America hit you?" I went on in a business-like voice, giving him the second question in my hat.

Before Bacchus could answer, a voice that sounded like a singing coal mine came over the top from the abysmal darkness of the cellar:

"Hoorah! Hoorah! I'm a guy — 'The Constitush has got me an' me corn!'"

"Can it!" shouted Bacchus. "That's the guy that put me on the blink. Why, his breath blew out the fires of Vulcan one morning Up There," continued Bacchus, addressing me.

"John was a low-brow, never could disguise himself and was always singing that late hours kill all the fun, and that fellow has certainly been a bad actor, although when there's any sickness around there ain't a better friend than John. But about prohibition, Bac?" I insisted, my reportorial instinct alert.

"Let me tell you, Benson," said Bacchus, poking his bottle of Nero's finest under my nose to emphasize his opinions, "that prohibition serves you right. You disgraced a god — that's me. I invented, over the years, the finest pleasures ever known — me and Gambrinus; but you Americans picked up with that rowdy John Barleycorn and his crazy roughneck, introduced him to your own tables, to your own families, and when you couldn't come in by the Family Entrance and went to ramming me into hideous red-ink joints and keeping me alive on bum table d'hotes, [by] some wise old adage that no one can offend a god and get away with the goods. Why, I'm the oldest and the healthiest of the gods, the best!

"As a matter of fact, since Mars still has a toothache and grouch, I've got to stick. I need America, and America needs me. You made me a Cinderella and lavished all your love on that demon back there. Look at me now — I've got to dress in this rig, go sneaking around from cellar to cellar with that rowdy back there — and I am celebrated by poets and prophets in the ages, the friend of laughter, the inventor of merriment.

"There never was one exception. The Eskimos never had any use for me — damn them! Ice eaters and the North Pole for a bathtub, and never a drop to warm them up. Jack Frost has got their souls as well as their bodies, and it'll get yours if you look out. Where life flourishes there the gods flourish."

And dear old Bacchus began to blubber all over the cask. Near me a voice began to croak:

"I'm old! I'm old! I'm beer — that's old! I'm going to get up cheer!"

"That's old Gam," said Bacchus, drying his eyes. "He too's in bad with me. I'll go to Jersey. The bottles will be near."

"Will you come back, Bacchus?" I asked, that being the third question pasted in my hat.

"Did you ever hear of a guy that tried to can me who didn't come back?" answered Bacchus, righting himself into something of his old-time form. "As badly as you are going to need me — and I've traveled a bit, about twenty-thousand sharps will tell you.

"Well, Benson, I can tell you there never was a nation that tried to can me who didn't start toward a Davy Jones' locker, which is, as you know, quite different from a club locker. The old stuff — don't drink it; where it begins to frost, there retire."

"What will be the ultimate effect of prohibition, Bac.?" I asked.

"Long faces, the dark brown taste of all real human beings, a universal mental grouch, and the disappearance of pleasure. Seriousness, my boy, has destroyed more people than even John, back there."

"Are you and the crowd back there going to get away with all this stock?" I asked.

"Every bit of it without drawing a cork. When Old Pale Ale gets back there'll not be a drop left — he left them, but—"

"How's that done?"

"We absorb it by psychometric thirst." Bacchus replied with a tremendous guffaw. His laugh was so loud that it startled me, and I took my hand off the bottle of Burgundy. Bacchus had disappeared.
