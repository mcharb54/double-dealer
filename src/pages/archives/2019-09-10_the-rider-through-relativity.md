The story below appeared in issue 3 of _The Double Dealer_. "The Rider Through Relativity" is a science fiction story concerned with Einstein's theory of  relativity. The theory was published in its final form in 1916, just a few years before the story below. 

Herman George Scheffauer was a German-American writer, poet, playwright, journalist and translator. Scheffauer was encouraged by his mentor, Ambrose Bierce, to quit his day job as an architect in order to focus on writing full time. 

The artwork used for this story is actually artwork from a play Scheffauer wrote titled _The Hollow Head of Mars._

"My death warrant," said Aurel Sharrington. He stared at the sheet in his hand, glaring white in the electric light that showered from his table lamp. The familiar writing of his old friend Dr. Hameroy, swam and swelled before his eyes. The long angular characters began to resemble, as he thought, lines of dancing skeletons, grotesquely interlocked. "I have made my final and decisive laboratory test," ran a passage in the letter. "If I did not know that you would damn me for hiding the truth, I would lie and say: there is hope. But your parents named you Aurelius, and I believe you have managed to prove that they did not misname you." "Dear Mark," murmured Sherrington, with a smile, "the compliment is forced, but he felt obliged to sugarcoat that pill." He let the letter drop on the desk, and reached for a sheet of paper. The pen thudded into the great crystal inkstand, then whispered over the coarse, hand-made paper: My Dear Eve: You are free—for I'm going to be free. There's no hope for me, I hear—so there is hope for you. Forgive the drama at thetail-end of my destiny—and be happy with whomever you may fee is necessary. . . . "How banal!" he muttered, tore the sheets into bits, seized another and wrote: My Dearest Eve . . . "That will do," said he, "so far as steel and ink are concerned. She will understand, as an intelligent wife should. The rest—" He opened a drawer in the desk—a small flat object shone with a dull blueblack lustre—he laid it upon the edge of the desk—a small automatic pistol. "— the rest is steel and fire." Odd, he thought, that one should be playful, almost witty—considering the occasion. A hangman's humor—or philosophy. The one thing that might reconcile one to remain is that one is constantly making new discoveries— those impressive death-bed sayings preserved so piously may be true after all —the last flare of the expiring match. Aurel Sharrington had come to a snarl in the threads of his existence. And he was for a Gordian solution— scarcely in keeping with the teachings of the philosopher after whom he had been named. His eye encompassed the triangle made by the two sheets of paper and the sinister weapon. "Here is my existence geometrically laid out," he mused, "a triangle—the bill for life and the bill for love. They've presented them a bit prematurely considering I am only thirty-three—thirty-three, three and thirty. Good old Hameroy will not bear me a grudge, I hope, for falsifying his forecast and dying of something else. He cannot condemn me to life to serve him as a kind of guinea-pig—it would not be fair." "As for Eve, she has grown used to living alone. She is Eve's true daughter and will survive. I was never meant to be her Adam. Well, to make a long matter of thirty-three years and God
