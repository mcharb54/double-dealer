<h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight:bold; color: inherit;">Editors' Note</h2>

The story below appeared in issue 3 of _The Double Dealer_. "The Rider Through Relativity" is a science fiction story concerned with Einstein's theory of  relativity. The theory was published in its final form in 1916, just a few years before the story below. 

Herman George Scheffauer was a German-American writer, poet, playwright, journalist and translator. Scheffauer was encouraged by his mentor, Ambrose Bierce, to quit his day job as an architect in order to focus on writing full time. 

The artwork used for this story is actually artwork from a play Scheffauer wrote titled _The Hollow Head of Mars._
