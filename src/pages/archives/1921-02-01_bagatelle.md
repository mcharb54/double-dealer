*A Play in One Act.*

*"........ et le comble de la finesse était de se surprende l'un ou l'autre à recevoir une bagatelle sans prononcer le mot sacramentel."* — Balzac.

**Persons:** Shabiyah, *The Gazelle.* Kasim, *The Philosopher.* Faroun, *The Husband.*

**Scene:** *The interior of an Arab's tent on the edge of the desert. At the spectator's right is a divan composed of saddle-bags, carpets and pillows. At his right, a large chest. A mirror of burnished copper hangs on the tent wall back of chest. The only entrance and exit is a door, at center rear, screened by a flap of the tent so that it cuts off from the interior the glare of the sun.*

*As the curtain rises, SHABIYAH is seated cross-legged on the divan, playing a lute. She puts down the lute, yawns, listens, and hearing someone, goes to back of tent to look out.*

**SHABIYAH**
*(Seeing someone, after a pause speaks)*
In Allah's name, wilt thou not rest in the shade?

**KASIM**
*(In the doorway)*
There is no God but Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful! I came hither because of the palm-tree.

**SHABIYAH**
This tent has spread itself in the shadow of the palm tree. Rest in its shade.

**KASIM**
*(Following her into tent)*
I hear and obey.

**SHABIYAH**
Tell me, O youth, what is thy name?

**KASIM**
My name is Kasim.

**SHABIYAH**
O Kasim, rest on these carpets.
*(She brings a basin and ewer of copper and pours water over his hands)*

**SHABIYAH**
*(Placing before him a tray containing a dish of fresh dates and a vessel of milk and a cup)*
O Kasim, eat of these fruits for 'we have no other meat, and fear nothing from me.

*(Kasim eats. He then washes his hands and mouth in the same manner as before but more thoroughly.)*

**SHABIYAH**
Now thou hast eaten, O Kasim, tell me whence thou art and how camest thou hither.

**KASIM**
O damsel. . .

**SHABIYAH**
Thou mayest call me Shabiyah.

**KASIM**
O Shabiyah, know that I am of the city of Cairo and that I am travelling toward Bagdad with a company of merchants who have halted not far from this place.

**SHABIYAH**
Thou art a merchant?

**KASIM**
I am a philosopher.

**SHABIYAH**
By Allah, thou art young for a philosopher!

**KASIM**
Indeed, I am no ordinary philosopher.

**SHABIYAH**
What marvel is this!

**KASIM**
Know, O Shabiyah, that of philosophers there are two kinds; ordinary philosophers, who are frequently old and always tedious; and extraordinary philosophers, whose wisdom is the flower of observation and the fruit of experience. *(He draws from his vest a book which he reads.)*
*(Pause).*

**SHABIYAH**
Thy book—O philosopher of the age—since it appears the sole object worthy of attention; permit me to ask the name of the science it treats?

**KASIM**
This book is beyond the understanding of women.

*(Pause, during which Kasim reads while Shabiyah watches him from under her eyelashes.)*

**SHABIYAH**
My husband is away.

**KASIM**
Thy husband . . .

**SHABIYAH**
Faroun . . . He is gone to the bazaar.

**KASIM**
*(Neglecting his book)*
Ah!

**SHABIYAH**
He is buying a gold chain.

**KASIM**
Buys he this chain for thee, O gazelle?

**SHABIYAH**
Yes and no. It will be mine only if I win it from him at Bagatelle.

**KASIM**
Bagatelle?

**SHABIYAH**
Bagatelle. Thou hast never played it?

**KASIM**
No.

**SHABIYAH**
O Kasim, it is a game played for a forfeit. The players are two; the forfeit whatever they agree on. My Faroun and I have agreed to play for a gold chain.

**KASIM**
How does one play this game?

**SHABIYAH**
To win the forfeit—one must surprise whomever one is playing with, into accepting a key, a flower, a book—some bagatelle!—without that other saying the word "bagatelle."

**KASIM**
Shall *we* play Bagatelle?

**SHABIYAH**
Agreed; and for what forfeit?

**KASIM**
Do thou name it.

**SHABIYAH**
The ruby on thy finger.

**KASIM**
This ring? *(holding it up).*

**SHABIYAH**
In the name of Allah, yes.

**KASIM**
I would not part with it for a thousand dirhams.

**SHABIYAH**
Has it a history?

**KASIM**
This ring was given me by a most beautiful and wise lady, with the words "O Kasim, I have taught thee all I know; there is nothing more we can teach thee."

**SHABIYAH**
Allah is all-knowing. Let us play for the ring?

**KASIM**
So be it.

**SHABIYAH**
It is agreed; and Allah is my witness. O Kasim, remember—Take nothing at my hand without at the same time saying the all-important word . . .

**KASIM**
Not even a kiss? *(He kisses her hand, exclaiming Bagatelle!)*

**SHABIYAH**
*(Laughing)*
Thou hast learned but the half of thy lesson, seeing that a kiss is not a bagatelle . . . *(Affecting surprise.)* But tell me? . . . Thou art no longer reading!

**KASIM**
I was distracted by thy beauty and grace.

**SHABIYAH**
Needs must thou tell me of this book? Verily my patience is at an end on thy account.

**KASIM**
*(Drawing a deep breath)*
I am the author of this work but the subject matter is not of mine invention—It is a collection of all the tricks, rogueries, ruses and wiles that women have invented and of which they are capable.

**SHABIYAH**
What! . . . All? . . .

**KASIM**
Yes. . . . All.

**SHABIYAH**
And is thy book the flower of observation?

**KASIM**
It is even so.

**SHABIYAH**
And the fruit of thine own experience?

**KASIM**
Thou hast said it.

**SHABIYAH**
Hast thou forgotten the whole or a part of thy wisdom?

**KASIM**
How so?

**SHABIYAH**
Why wast thou reading, then?

**KASIM**
To avoid temptation.

**SHABIYAH**
And now?

**KASIM**
I seek thy beauty and grace for thy face beams with light, thy cheeks are rose-red and thine eyelids langorous.

**SHABIYAH**
*(Slyly).*
Hast thou no fear that I play thee a trick *not* in thy collection?

**KASIM**
No, for through the constant study of women I have arrived at a state where I no longer fear them.

**SHABIYAH**
Ah . . .
*(Pause.)*

**SHABIYAH**
Philosopher of the age?

**KASIM**
What wouldst thou, garden of delights?

**SHABIYAH**
O Kasim, I would have thee abide with me a while that thou mayest tell me thy history and acquaint me with the rare adventures that have come to thy knowledge . . .

**KASIM**
What? All!

**SHABIYAH**
Yes . . . All.

**KASIM**
So be it. But, ere I begin. I will enact an adventure . . .

**SHABIYAH**
What tale is this?

**KASIM**
By Allah, my heart is well-nigh torn in sunder with longing for thee; nor will I let half the day pass ere I possess thee and take my fill of thy beauty and grace.

**SHABIYAH**
Bethink thee what thou wilt do.

**KASIM**
How so?

**SHABIYAH**
Belike it may come to my husband's ears, and who will deliver us from his hand . . .

**KASIM**
Is not thy husband at the bazaar?

**SHABIYAH**
Yes.

**KASIM**
How will he know of this? *(He kisses her mouth.)* Thy hair is like the nights of estrangment and separation and thy face like the days of union . .

**SHABIYAH**
*(Breaks from his embrace, sits upright, listens).*
Didst thou not hear?

**KASIM**
What?

*(She goes to door of tent and listens.)*

**SHABIYAH**
*(Startled).*
It is his horse! My husband will be here in a moment!

**KASIM**
*(Jumps from divan. His book, unnoticed, falling to floor right of divan).*

**SHABIYAH**
He is as jealous as a tiger and as pitiless. If Faroun find you here, he will kill us both.

*(Kasim starts for door.)*

**SHABIYAH**
*(Divining his intent).*
Hasten not to destroy thyself. He will see thee . . . *(with a flash of inspiration.)* The chest—there is nothing for it but that thou hide in the chest!

*(Kasim hesitates.)*

**SHABIYAH**
Art thou afraid?

**KASIM**
Yes.

**SHABIYAH**
By Allah and if thou valuest thy life, quick, hide in this chest.

**KASIM**
*(Getting into chest)*
I commit my affair unto Allah for no one can avoid what he hath decreed.

**SHABIYAH**
*(Locks chest with key which she attaches again to her girdle; glances around the tent and sees the book).*

**SHABIYAH**
*(Shoving the book under the divan with her foot).*
And it be the will of Allah, I will show thee a trick not in thy book!

*(She adds Kohl to her eyelids and a little more red to her lips, and is ready, a few seconds later, to receive, with a thousand blandishments, Faroun, who enters).*

**SHABIYAH**
O my Lord and light of mine eyes . .

**FAROUN**
*(Fondling her).*
Gazelle.

**SHABIYAH**
Blessed be Allah and his Prophet, thou art returned sooner than I expected.

**FAROUN**
Gazelle, I had not come but out of longing for the sight of thy face, for I must again to the bazaar on a matter of business *(sits on divan).*

**SHABIYAH**
Wilt thou partake of some refreshment?

**FAROUN**
What is there?

**SHABIYAH**
Dates and milk.

**FAROUN**
I am not hungry. I will smoke my nargileh.

*(Faroun proceeds to smoke the nargileh while Shabiyah seats herself on a cushion not far from his feet).*

**FAROUN**
Tell me, gazelle, how hast thou passed the time during mine absence!

**SHABIYAH**
*(Fervently).*
There is no power and no virtue but in Allah, the most high, the Sublime? . . .

**FAROUN**
Hast thou some rare story to tell me or some marvel to make known to me?

**SHABIYAH**
*(Quietly and with perfect self possession).*
There is nothing for it but that I tell thee the whole truth, hiding naught of a singular adventure that befell me . .

**FAROUN**
I am listening, my gazelle.

**SHABIYAH**
There came here a kind of philosopher, who claims that he has collected into a book all the tricks, rogueries, ruses and wiles that women have invented and of which they are capable . . .

**FAROUN**
I am listening.

**SHABIYAH**
And this philosopher is a goodly youth with shining face and slender shape, black eyes and joined eyebrows . . .

**FAROUN**
Go on, I am listening . . .

**SHABIYAH**
*(With animation).*
He was ardent, impetuous—he threw his arms about me, and . . .

**FAROUN**
*(Terrible)*—And?

**SHABIYAH**
Thou camest in time to save my faltering virtue.

**FAROUN**
*(Bounds from the divan, a long knife in his hand. Shabiyah falls at his feet).*

**FAROUN**
*(Taking her by the hair).*
Where is this dog? Produce him to my sight!

**SHABIYAH**
*(Embracing his knees).*
Thou wilt not kill me?

**FAROUN**
*(Threatening her with the knife).*
By Allah, if thou wouldst live, speak—where is this dog?

**SHABIYAH**
*(With a glance as prompt as it is timid)*
The chest.

**FAROUN**
*(Taking a stride toward the chest).*
Ah! . . .

**SHABIYAH**
*(Proffering the key, her eyes downcast).*
It is locked . . .

**FAROUN**
*(Snatches the key from her hand; runs toward the chest and is on the point of inserting the key in the lock when he is stopped by an explosion of laughter from Shabiyah).*

**SHABIYAH**
*(Swaying with delight).*
The chain, the chain! Give me the gold chain! Thou hast forgotten the bagatelle thou snatched from me! . . .

*(The key drops to the floor.)*

**FAROUN**
By the heart of the Prophet! . . .

**SHABIYAH**
Thou hast lost thy chain. O Faroun, give it me. Have I not won it?

**FAROUN**
Thou hast indeed won it *(He goes toward her with the chain, his knife no longer visible)*.. O subtlest of gazelles, here is thy chain. Another time, play no such cruel trick . . .

**SHABIYAH**
*(Taking the chain)*
My Faroun, it is not easy to catch thee; thou hast usually a better memory . . .

**FAROUN**
Play me no such trick again, and I will bring thee the wealth of all the caravans that pass in a year. *(He starts to go).*

**SHABIYAH**
*(Arranging her hair before the mirror.)*
What, art thou leaving?

**FAROUN**
Yes.

**SHABIYAH**
O my husband, let this suffice thee of ignoble suspicion and never again deem ill of me.

**FAROUN**
So be it.

**SHABIYAH**
*(Approaching him).*
Accord me pardon for what is past.

**FAROUN**
Allah grant thee grace!

**SHABIYAH**
Be absent but a little while, O Faroun for I cannot endure to be parted from thee even for an hour.

*(Faroun goes).*

**SHABIYAH**
*(Listens to make sure that he is gone; then, picking up the key, she unlocks and opens the chest).*

*(Kasim's head and shoulders appear. He is pale and trembling).*

**SHABIYAH**
*(In a whisper).*
He is gone . . .

**KASIM**
*(Getting out of chest).*
Ah.

**SHABIYAH**
Praised be Allah who hath made the affair to end well; and we implore the Almighty to crown his favors with thy safe faring forth this place.

**KASIM**
Is the way clear?

**SHABIYAH**
Yes.

**KASIM**
*(Starting to go).*
Farewell.

**SHABIYAH**
What, art thou going too?

**KASIM**
*(In a flutter to be gone).*
By Allah, yes.

*(He has reached the door when he stops.)*

**SHABIYAH**
Thy book—delay a little—thou hast forgotten thy book!

**KASIM**
*(Feeling in his vest).*
Ah *(Coming toward her).* Give it me that I may go my way, for I will no longer in this place.

**SHABIYAH**
I hear and obey.

*(Shabiyah gets the book from under the divan. Kasim snatches it eagerly from her hands and starts for the door.)*

**SHABIYAH**
Stay, in the name of Allah, there is something else! . .

**KASIM**
*(Startled).*
What?

**SHABIYAH**
Thou hast forgotten we are playing Bagatelle. Did I not warn thee—"Take nothing from my hand without at the same time saying the all-important word."

**KASIM**
In the name of Allah . . .

**SHABIYAH**
The ruby—the ruby on thy finger. Thou promised it and Allah is witness of what I say.

**KASIM**
I promised no less a forfeit; therefore, it is thine. *(Drawing it from his finger).* Here . . . take it.

**SHABIYAH**
*(Taking the ring).*
How beautiful it is—it will remind me of thee! Wilt thou not stay?

**KASIM**
No.

**SHABIYAH**
Art thou afraid?

**KASIM**
I mistrust thee.

**SHABIYAH**
Come, tell me, how dost thou like my chain?

**KASIM**
Would I had never seen thee.

**SHABIYAH**
O Kasim, have I played thee a trick *not* in thy book?

**KASIM**
One glance at thee has cost me a thousand sighs for indeed thou hast ravished my wit. Farewell.

**SHABIYAH**
Delay a little. My Faroun is away for hours at a time and there is seldom here a philosopher to delight mine ears. Wilt thou not stay?

**KASIM**
Why should I?

**SHABIYAH**
Stay and see. I will give thee thy ring again.

**KASIM**
Not for the ruby together with thy gold chain would I stay . . .

**SHABIYAH**
I will give thee a kiss.

**KASIM**
Not even a kiss. Farewell . . .

**SHABIYAH**
Philosopher of the age?

**KASIM**
*(Turning at door).*
What wouldst thou now of me?

**SHABIYAH**
Forget not to include this Bagatelle in thy collection.

*(Kasim goes).*

*CURTAIN.*
