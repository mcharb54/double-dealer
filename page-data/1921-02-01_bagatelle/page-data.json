At the spectator's right is a divan composed of saddle-bags, carpets and pillows. At his right, a large chest. A mirror of burnished copper hangs on the tent wall back of chest. The only entrance and exit is a door, at center rear, screened by a flap of the tent so that it cuts off from the interior the glare of the sun.</em></p>\n<p><em>As the curtain rises, SHABIYAH is seated cross-legged on the divan, playing a lute. She puts down the lute, yawns, listens, and hearing someone, goes to back of tent to look out.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(Seeing someone, after a pause speaks)</em>\nIn Allah's name, wilt thou not rest in the shade?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\n<em>(In the doorway)</em>\nThere is no God but Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful! I came hither because of the palm-tree.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nThis tent has spread itself in the shadow of the palm tree. Rest in its shade.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\n<em>(Following her into tent)</em>\nI hear and obey.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nTell me, O youth, what is thy name?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nMy name is Kasim.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nO Kasim, rest on these carpets.\n<em>(She brings a basin and ewer of copper and pours water over his hands)</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(Placing before him a tray containing a dish of fresh dates and a vessel of milk and a cup)</em>\nO Kasim, eat of these fruits for 'we have no other meat, and fear nothing from me.</p>\n<p><em>(Kasim eats. He then washes his hands and mouth in the same manner as before but more thoroughly.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nNow thou hast eaten, O Kasim, tell me whence thou art and how camest thou hither.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nO damsel. . .</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nThou mayest call me Shabiyah.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nO Shabiyah, know that I am of the city of Cairo and that I am travelling toward Bagdad with a company of merchants who have halted not far from this place.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nThou art a merchant?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nI am a philosopher.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nBy Allah, thou art young for a philosopher!</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nIndeed, I am no ordinary philosopher.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nWhat marvel is this!</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nKnow, O Shabiyah, that of philosophers there are two kinds; ordinary philosophers, who are frequently old and always tedious; and extraordinary philosophers, whose wisdom is the flower of observation and the fruit of experience. <em>(He draws from his vest a book which he reads.)</em>\n<em>(Pause).</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nThy book—O philosopher of the age—since it appears the sole object worthy of attention; permit me to ask the name of the science it treats?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nThis book is beyond the understanding of women.</p>\n<p><em>(Pause, during which Kasim reads while Shabiyah watches him from under her eyelashes.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nMy husband is away.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nThy husband . . .</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nFaroun . . . He is gone to the bazaar.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\n<em>(Neglecting his book)</em>\nAh!</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nHe is buying a gold chain.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nBuys he this chain for thee, O gazelle?</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nYes and no. It will be mine only if I win it from him at Bagatelle.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nBagatelle?</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nBagatelle. Thou hast never played it?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nNo.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nO Kasim, it is a game played for a forfeit. The players are two; the forfeit whatever they agree on. My Faroun and I have agreed to play for a gold chain.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nHow does one play this game?</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nTo win the forfeit—one must surprise whomever one is playing with, into accepting a key, a flower, a book—some bagatelle!—without that other saying the word \"bagatelle.\"</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nShall <em>we</em> play Bagatelle?</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nAgreed; and for what forfeit?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nDo thou name it.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nThe ruby on thy finger.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nThis ring? <em>(holding it up).</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nIn the name of Allah, yes.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nI would not part with it for a thousand dirhams.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nHas it a history?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nThis ring was given me by a most beautiful and wise lady, with the words \"O Kasim, I have taught thee all I know; there is nothing more we can teach thee.\"</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nAllah is all-knowing. Let us play for the ring?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nSo be it.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nIt is agreed; and Allah is my witness. O Kasim, remember—Take nothing at my hand without at the same time saying the all-important word . . .</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nNot even a kiss? <em>(He kisses her hand, exclaiming Bagatelle!)</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(Laughing)</em>\nThou hast learned but the half of thy lesson, seeing that a kiss is not a bagatelle . . . <em>(Affecting surprise.)</em> But tell me? . . . Thou art no longer reading!</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nI was distracted by thy beauty and grace.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nNeeds must thou tell me of this book? Verily my patience is at an end on thy account.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\n<em>(Drawing a deep breath)</em>\nI am the author of this work but the subject matter is not of mine invention—It is a collection of all the tricks, rogueries, ruses and wiles that women have invented and of which they are capable.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nWhat! . . . All? . . .</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nYes. . . . All.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nAnd is thy book the flower of observation?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nIt is even so.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nAnd the fruit of thine own experience?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nThou hast said it.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nHast thou forgotten the whole or a part of thy wisdom?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nHow so?</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nWhy wast thou reading, then?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nTo avoid temptation.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nAnd now?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nI seek thy beauty and grace for thy face beams with light, thy cheeks are rose-red and thine eyelids langorous.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(Slyly).</em>\nHast thou no fear that I play thee a trick <em>not</em> in thy collection?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nNo, for through the constant study of women I have arrived at a state where I no longer fear them.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nAh . . .\n<em>(Pause.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nPhilosopher of the age?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nWhat wouldst thou, garden of delights?</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nO Kasim, I would have thee abide with me a while that thou mayest tell me thy history and acquaint me with the rare adventures that have come to thy knowledge . . .</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nWhat? All!</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nYes . . . All.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nSo be it. But, ere I begin. I will enact an adventure . . .</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nWhat tale is this?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nBy Allah, my heart is well-nigh torn in sunder with longing for thee; nor will I let half the day pass ere I possess thee and take my fill of thy beauty and grace.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nBethink thee what thou wilt do.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nHow so?</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nBelike it may come to my husband's ears, and who will deliver us from his hand . . .</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nIs not thy husband at the bazaar?</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nYes.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nHow will he know of this? <em>(He kisses her mouth.)</em> Thy hair is like the nights of estrangment and separation and thy face like the days of union . .</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(Breaks from his embrace, sits upright, listens).</em>\nDidst thou not hear?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nWhat?</p>\n<p><em>(She goes to door of tent and listens.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(Startled).</em>\nIt is his horse! My husband will be here in a moment!</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\n<em>(Jumps from divan. His book, unnoticed, falling to floor right of divan).</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nHe is as jealous as a tiger and as pitiless. If Faroun find you here, he will kill us both.</p>\n<p><em>(Kasim starts for door.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(Divining his intent).</em>\nHasten not to destroy thyself. He will see thee . . . <em>(with a flash of inspiration.)</em> The chest—there is nothing for it but that thou hide in the chest!</p>\n<p><em>(Kasim hesitates.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nArt thou afraid?</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\nYes.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nBy Allah and if thou valuest thy life, quick, hide in this chest.</p>\n<p><strong>KASIM</strong>\n<em>(Getting into chest)</em>\nI commit my affair unto Allah for no one can avoid what he hath decreed.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(Locks chest with key which she attaches again to her girdle; glances around the tent and sees the book).</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(Shoving the book under the divan with her foot).</em>\nAnd it be the will of Allah, I will show thee a trick not in thy book!</p>\n<p><em>(She adds Kohl to her eyelids and a little more red to her lips, and is ready, a few seconds later, to receive, with a thousand blandishments, Faroun, who enters).</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nO my Lord and light of mine eyes . .</p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\n<em>(Fondling her).</em>\nGazelle.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nBlessed be Allah and his Prophet, thou art returned sooner than I expected.</p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\nGazelle, I had not come but out of longing for the sight of thy face, for I must again to the bazaar on a matter of business <em>(sits on divan).</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nWilt thou partake of some refreshment?</p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\nWhat is there?</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nDates and milk.</p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\nI am not hungry. I will smoke my nargileh.</p>\n<p><em>(Faroun proceeds to smoke the nargileh while Shabiyah seats herself on a cushion not far from his feet).</em></p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\nTell me, gazelle, how hast thou passed the time during mine absence!</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(Fervently).</em>\nThere is no power and no virtue but in Allah, the most high, the Sublime? . . .</p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\nHast thou some rare story to tell me or some marvel to make known to me?</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(Quietly and with perfect self possession).</em>\nThere is nothing for it but that I tell thee the whole truth, hiding naught of a singular adventure that befell me . .</p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\nI am listening, my gazelle.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nThere came here a kind of philosopher, who claims that he has collected into a book all the tricks, rogueries, ruses and wiles that women have invented and of which they are capable . . .</p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\nI am listening.</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nAnd this philosopher is a goodly youth with shining face and slender shape, black eyes and joined eyebrows . . .</p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\nGo on, I am listening . . .</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(With animation).</em>\nHe was ardent, impetuous—he threw his arms about me, and . . .</p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\n<em>(Terrible)</em>—And?</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nThou camest in time to save my faltering virtue.</p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\n<em>(Bounds from the divan, a long knife in his hand. Shabiyah falls at his feet).</em></p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\n<em>(Taking her by the hair).</em>\nWhere is this dog? Produce him to my sight!</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(Embracing his knees).</em>\nThou wilt not kill me?</p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\n<em>(Threatening her with the knife).</em>\nBy Allah, if thou wouldst live, speak—where is this dog?</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(With a glance as prompt as it is timid)</em>\nThe chest.</p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\n<em>(Taking a stride toward the chest).</em>\nAh! . . .</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(Proffering the key, her eyes downcast).</em>\nIt is locked . . .</p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\n<em>(Snatches the key from her hand; runs toward the chest and is on the point of inserting the key in the lock when he is stopped by an explosion of laughter from Shabiyah).</em></p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\n<em>(Swaying with delight).</em>\nThe chain, the chain! Give me the gold chain! Thou hast forgotten the bagatelle thou snatched from me! . . .</p>\n<p><em>(The key drops to the floor.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\nBy the heart of the Prophet! . . .</p>\n<p><strong>SHABIYAH</strong>\nThou hast lost thy chain. O Faroun, give it me. Have I not won it?</p>\n<p><strong>FAROUN</strong>\nThou hast indeed won it <em>(He goes toward her with the chain, his knife no longer visible)</em>..
